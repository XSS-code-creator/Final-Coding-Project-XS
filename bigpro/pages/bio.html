            <h2>Things Fall Apart</h2>
            <p>
                The best heroes fail. My definition of a hero is a person who has noble qualities and is on a difficult quest. The most memorable heroes are tragic heroes – those who reach great heights but ultimately fail in their quest and fall from the heights. In Things Fall Apart, by Chinua Achebe, Okonkwo is a tragic hero: Things come together very quickly for him, but in the end things fall apart. He grew up poor and inherited nothing from his father, who Okonkwo saw as agbala, or weak. Okonkwo’s quest was to be the opposite of agbala – to never show weakness and to live by a warrior’s code of honor. This warrior’s code drove Okonkwo to develop many heroic qualities, like courage and strength, and to become a great warrior and respected leader in the community. But in the end, Okonkwo’s desire to never show weakness became his tragic flaw, leading him to take impulsive and violent actions. Okonkwo is a tragic hero because his quest to be a respected warrior – to be the opposite of agbala – leads him to great heights, but also to the violence that causes his demise. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Okonkwo’s quest begins in fear – fear of being weak and lazy like his father drives Okonkwo’s quest to become a great warrior and a prosperous farmer. “[E]ven now he still remembered how he had suffered when a playmate had told him that his father was agbala. That was how Okonkwo first came to know that agbala was not only another name for a woman, it could also mean a man who had taken no title” (13). Okonkwo’s shame drives him to become the opposite of everything his father was. “And so Okonkwo was ruled by one passion—to hate everything that his father Unoka had loved. One of those things was gentleness and another was idleness” (13). To show that he was strong, not weak like his father, Okonkwo set out to become a wrestler and “won fame as the greatest wrestler in the nine villages” (8). Okonkwo also worked hard to become prosperous and respected. “He was a wealthy farmer and had two barns full of yams, and had just married his third wife. To crown it all he had taken two titles and had shown incredible prowess in two inter-tribal wars” (8). Okonkwo’s fear of being weak like his father drove him to develop many exceptional qualities – strength, courage, and perseverance –  and his achievements made him “one of the greatest men of his time” (8).
            </p>
            <p>
                The same fear of appearing weak that drove Okonkwo to become a great warrior also caused him to act in impulsive and violent ways, bringing about his fall from greatness and his death. For example, when the elders decide Ikemefuna should be killed, Okonkwo’s love for the child is overcome by his fear of “being thought weak… Dazed with fear, Okonkwo drew his machete and cut him down” (61), even though this caused Okonkwo great sadness, and he mourned for days afterward, not eating or drinking anything except palm wine. In another example, when his second wife questioned his manhood, “Okonkwo heard it and ran madly into his room for the loaded gun, ran out again and aimed at her… [h]e pressed the trigger and there was a loud report” (39). Luckily, in this case the shot missed, but Okonkwo’s impulsive violence would ultimately become his undoing. As the white men imposed their authority on the village, Okonkwo became “choked with hate” (195) and urged his fellow villagers to resist. With his warrior code of honor, Okonkwo “mourned for the warlike men of Umuofia, who had so unaccountably become soft like women” (183). In the book’s climactic scene, the village is meeting to decide whether to fight to preserve their way of life when the head messenger arrives with other white men to order the meeting to stop. “[T]rembling with hate … Okonkwo drew his machete … [It] descended twice and the man’s head lay beside his uniformed body.” (204). When Okonkwo saw that his fellow villagers had let the other white men escape, he “knew that Umuofia would not go to war … He wiped his machete on the sand and went away” (205). When the white men return to arrest him, they learn he has already taken his own life. Okonkwo’s warrior code of honor, which led him to heroic acts and achievements, ultimately proved to be his tragic flaw, leading to the rash act of violence that was his undoing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Okonkwo is a tragic hero, and his story is memorable and moving because it is familiar – we recognize the same motivations and struggles in ourselves and others, so we feel a sense of catharsis as we hear Okonkwo’s story with its tragic end. We had a similar experience of catharsis in hearing the story of Dally in The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton. Like Okonkwo, Dally is driven by his personal code of honor to do things that are heroic and self-sacrificing, but also to do things that are ultimately self-destructive. He gives his gun to Johnny and Ponyboy when they are on the run, even though that could get him arrested, and he risks his life to pull Johnny from a burning building. But like Okonkwo, Dally’s sense of honor leads him to commit suicide, drawing an unloaded gun on armed policemen, knowing they would have to shoot him. “He died gallant” (The Outsiders 154), and the same could be said of Okonkwo, who chose to take his own life rather than submit to others. In the end, we can see a lot of ourselves in Okonkwo, but we can also take some lessons from his story. There is a saying, “all good things are done in moderation.” If Okonkwo could have tempered his warrior’s code with a sense of moderation, maybe he could still have achieved a lot, while avoiding his tragic fate. On the other hand, if Okonkwo had subdued his impulses and kept things from falling apart, would he be such a memorable hero?

            <h2>Our Doom</h2>
            <p>
                The Big Bang. The Creation of Our Solar System. The Beginning of Life on Earth.  The Cambrian Explosion. The Great Dying. The KT extinction. Humans. These are the steps that have made our existence possible. Without each of these extreme events we wouldn’t exist. These extreme events, our normal geological events just amplified. Earthquakes turn into mega-quakes, Volcanic eruptions into super eruptions, floods into megafloods. We will be the cause of the next extreme event if we do nothing to stop the growing presence of global warming. While Earth is partially responsible for global warming, it has natural ways of counter-balancing it. However, humans are also responsible for global warming and we also have the means to hinder it. If we don’t, however, we will experience an extreme geological event within the next 50 years. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Nature is partially responsible for global warming, releasing carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere.  Volcanoes are estimated annually to produce 200 million tons of carbon dioxide each year. However what if a super eruption occurred? In the US Yellowstone houses a dangerous and deadly volcano. The super volcano in the past erupted with extreme violence, blowing so much ash into the air that even the East coast got a dusting of ash. Right now the underground magma chamber is slowly filling, pushing the land above it skywards (move 1 inch per year). If it erupted we could have a crisis on our hands. The earth, unlike us, however, can mostly fix its mistakes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately (for us), the Earth has natural ways of absorbing greenhouse gasses. Carbon dioxide can be absorbed in lava rock through weathering. This mainly occurs at the Equator. “This CO2 consumption occurs through chemical reactions with the mineral calcium silicate that is abundant in volcanic rocks. These reactions form the mineral calcium carbonate… It is buried at the bottom of the world’s ocean, consequently removing it from the atmosphere for millions of years” (video 1.16). Methane is destroyed in many ways. First, Bacteria in soil and water eat the gas. Secondly, a reaction with atmospheric hydroxyl (OH) or chlorine (CL) in the troposphere is another way to destroy this greenhouse gas. On average Methane is destroyed after 30 years of decimating the atmosphere. However nature isn’t the only cause of global warming, we are too. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We are a huge problem to our environment. We are changing the conditions for life, just as the cyanobacteria did 2.3 billion years ago, releasing oxygen into the atmosphere for the first time. Before this the atmosphere was made of greenhouse gasses and was very hot. The cyanobacteria took in carbon dioxide (Co2), building out using the carbon (C), and expelling the oxygen (O) as waste. The conditions for life rapidly changed. Any organism alive then that couldn’t survive the poisonous oxygen (O) went extinct. With tons of oxygen in the atmosphere, the Earth was plunged into an era of ice (Snowball Earth). Today, as a result of the legacy of the cyanobacteria, adapting to survive off of the gas that was plentiful. Our impact on the world is huge. With our fossil fuels we are helping the carbon dioxide reign again. Burning natural gas, gasoline, diesel, oil, and crude oil, we are producing tons of carbon dioxide.  The main methane producers are our cows. Cows eat grass and fart methane. Once up in the upper atmosphere, the methane starts destroying the ozone layer. To make matters worse Methane is 25x more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Nitrogen Oxide is also a well known problem. Even Mr. “Global Warming is not happening”(Trump) has admitted this. When we burn Hydrogen we release Nitrogen oxide, which up in the atmosphere has a chemical reaction that results to form acid rain. Unfortunately this problem has no known fixes that entirely work. CFCs are a compound that are produced in many household items. When released they drift up into the atmosphere. “Once in the atmosphere, CFCs drift slowly upward to the stratosphere, where they are broken up by ultraviolet radiation, releasing chlorine atoms, which are able to destroy ozone molecules” (online website (2018 UCAR)). If we want to avoid destruction we need to fix what we have done.
            </p>
            <p>
                To right our wrongs we need to catch the rogue greenhouse gasses that we put in our atmosphere before it is too late. The biggest producer of emissions: our power plants. To start on our journey to redemption we need to move to renewable power sources, power alternatives that don’t pollute the environment.  Then the next step. We need then to turn our attention to the emissions already in the atmosphere. To rid the air of the excess carbon dioxide we could create more weathering where igneous rocks are, absorbing more carbon dioxide. To get the methane out we need to stop eating beef. Then, fortunately, methane disappears out of the atmosphere after about 30 years. Sadly however there are no fixes for the Nitrogen oxide problem. Finally we just need to stop using products with CFCs in them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I think if we were to ignore the crisis at hand, it will happen in the next 50 years. Continued thinning of the ozone layer could result in more cancer from harmful solar radiation. First the sea level will rise. Then the destruction would start. Miami will be underwater. Manhattan will either make leves or turn into a Venice like city. New Orleans will be long gone. All communities under 70 meters above sea level will be underwater. The next mass extinction of life on Earth will be happening. All of the coral reefs and their ecosystems will die out. Humans living in the Sahara Desert will run out of water and die out. We need to get our act together if we want to save our planet. 
            </p>
            <p>
                While the Earth and Humans are both responsible for global warming, the Earth absorbs it, unlike us who can, but aren’t doing much. If we continue on this path of destruction, we will experience an extreme geological event within 50 years. The Earth is in a balance. By itself, it is able to balance the greenhouse gasses, expelling them into the atmosphere, but also absorbing it in igneous rocks.  However when we, us, humans get into the mix, we have a choice. Should we tip it one way or another, or should we simply try and keep the scale balanced. Right now, the scale is leaning toward the side of extreme heat, killing many of the organisms all over the globe, the ones that lack the ability to quickly evolve. Even though Miami is doomed, people think, “that's years off, I have time.” The truth however is few people have the vision to plan for the future. Most are focusing just on the present, on short term gains. However, think about the next generation of humans, or the next. What will they think of us, who even possessing the ability to fix the damage, instead have augmented it. The next 20 years if we just sit back, relax, and watch the sea level rise, only then will everyone understand how only 20 years earlier, we could have diverted this impending doom.

                <p>
                    USS Arizona sunk. USS Oklahoma gone. USS Utah lost. 2,403 dead.[1] 3,581 casualties.[2] The day that will live in infamy. December 7, 1941. Pearl Harbor. While the Japanese plan was ingenious, US forces could still have blunted the effects of the attack if the US had better prepared in advance, and if the first signs of attack had been heeded. US failures made Pearl Harbor much bloodier and more devastating than it had to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Japanese plan was brilliant, and even a well prepared and vigilant enemy would have taken significant damage. Timing planned a significant role in the success of their attack. In summers, the entire island’s coast around Oahu was patrolled. During the winter, however, it was assumed that no sane enemy would attack from the north. Huge waves made smaller vessels, like destroyers, buck and rock like insignificant pieces of driftwood. Because of this, the Navy only patrolled the waters to the south. So, when the enemy came from the north, they met no patrols and were able to launch their planes. When the planes reached Ohau, they targeted airstrips, hangers, and the harbor. The Japanese also cleverly planned their attack for a Sunday, when most of the soldiers were on leave or in church. Finally, up until the bombs were dropped, Japanese diplomats were still “negotiating” with the US. As a result, the US thought war would be avoided and were thus lulled into complacency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this Japanese plan was ingenious and was always likely to damage the US Pacific Fleet, this damage was made so much worse by the US forces' failure to prepare in advance. This lack of preparation manifested in several very damaging ways. First there was no unity of command: the Army and Navy units at Pearl Harbor each had separate commanders. Lt. Gen. Walter C. Short commanded the Army based in Hawaii. Under his command were some 234 aircraft, including 134 fighter aircraft. The safety of the Pacific Fleet based in Pearl Harbor, technically should have rested upon the Army’s fighter aircraft and the anti-aircraft guns. Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, on the other hand, was the commander of the Pacific Fleet. Present in the harbor at the time of the attack, he had eight Battleships, eight Cruisers, forty two Destroyers, four Submarines, and thirty nine other ships[3]. Kimmel and Short were peers — neither could give the other orders, but to make matters worse, they also didn’t like each other. This was detrimental to the unified front of defense and spelled doom for both of their careers and many of their men. Second, their lack of unified command was made worse by a lack of communication. When“ radio communications intelligence “lost” the location of Japanese carriers after November 17…” Kimmel chose not to share this with Short for “security reasons.” [4] The lack of cooperation between the US commanders set the island up for the impending disaster. So, at the end of November, when Washington sent out a War Warning, Short only prepared for domestic violence since he didn’t know about the carriers. Thus, the US aircraft weren’t ready for the Japanese attack. They had no patrols going, and their aircraft were parked wingtip to wingtip, right in the open. [5] Also, our equipment, vital to fighting back such an attack, was locked up, showing that we weren’t prepared for this situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the US’s lack of preparation, there were still opportunities that they could have taken advantage of to detect the impending strike, but these opportunities were missed. What should have sounded the general alarm just was disregarded.[6] In fact, there were at least three missed opportunities. First, at 6:45 am, the radar picked up two unidentified blips on the screen. These were two Japanese planes, looking for targets.[7] This was dismissed. Second, back in the Harbor, around 15 minutes earlier, the USS Ward, a destroyer tasked with defending the entrance to the harbor itself, broadcasted a message: “We Have Attacked, Fired Upon and Dropped Depth Charges on a Submarine Operating in the Defensive Sea Area.” That was by itself enough to sound a general alarm, but it was instead put aside to seek verification instead. Third, at 7:00 am the radar installations on the northern tip of Oahu spiked. The system started showing a large dot moving in from the north. Though they didn’t know it at the time, this was the first wave of the attack, comprising some 183 aircraft. The two very junior enlisted men, Joseph L. Lockhart and George E. Elliot, were operating this installation, were understandably perplexed, and sent a report to command. Lt. Kermit Tyler. He reads the report but then dismisses it. He recollected that this same day a flight of a dozen B-17’s were due from the west coast, and the flight trajectory was almost identical.[8] The workers at the radar installation failed to mention that the radar signal indicated more than 50 planes and Lt. Tyler failed to mention to the radar operators the inbound B17s only numbered a dozen — so they all mistakenly thought the radar signal was the friendly B-17s, not realizing that it was the first wave of the Japanese attacks. With all those warnings going unheeded, the Japanese achieved surprise and caught the US forces at Pearl Harbor completely by surprise, to devastating effect.[9]
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lack of US preparation, and failure to heed the warnings just before the attack, allowed the brilliant Japanese plan to succeed beyond its authors’ wildest hopes. The cost of the US failures was written in American losses: 2403 dead, 3581 casualties, and 7 ships sunk. It would be months before the US was able to rebuild its devastated fleet enough to begin to halt the Japanese advance in the Pacific.[10] Sometimes in war it is the little things that make the difference. If the US had established a unified command for Hawaii, if the branches of the US armed forces communicated and shared intelligence, if the USS Arizona hadn’t had its forward main magazine ignite, if the USS Oklahoma hadn’t rolled over and capsized, if the US navy patrolled the northern waters all year, actually if any of these mundane things had been different, the US forces at Pearl Harbor might have had fewer casualties.
